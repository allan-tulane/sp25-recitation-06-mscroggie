- **2)**$W(n) = 2^n$

- **3)**$W(n) = O(n)$

- **4)** the second element is the result and the first and third are the number before

- **6)** It only recurses the first time a value is called, so the work and span are both O(n) 

- **8)** they will only be read at most twice, so it has O(n) work. it still relies on previous function calls, so the span is O(n) as well
